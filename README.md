Day 49 which is File IO in Python | Python Tutorial - Day #49 on YouTube 
___________________________________________________________________________
I have created a file of Day 49 on my replit with this link : https://replit.com/@Nitin645Sokhal/Day49FileIo#main.py

The reason for creating a file for Day 49 on replit is that i am not able to see the output in the console of the python interpreter
even i have inserted the file name correctly in the IDE ==> Visual Studio Code

By clicking on this replit link (https://replit.com/@Nitin645Sokhal/Day49FileIo#main.py) i will redirect to that replit link with file named as File IO
